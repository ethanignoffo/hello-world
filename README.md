# About Me:

Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

My name is Ethan Ignoffo (he/him) and I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Berkeley's Rausser College of Natural Resources where I earned a B.S. in Environmental Economics & Policy and a minor in Conservation & Resource Studies. While at Berkeley, I conducted a senior thesis in the Coastal Climate Resilience Lab under the advising of Dr. Rachel R. Carlson. My research analyzed the impacts of federal investment on recovery outcomes for marine species listed under the Endangered Species Act. Previously, I have interned at Defenders of Wildlife and the UC Berkeley Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. I am broadly interested in climate change adaptation, coastal resource management, sustainable urban development, and marine species conservation, applying tools from environmental economics and policy analysis to data science and remote sensing in support of equitable and resilient coastal communities. Currently, I am pursuing an M.S. in Energy & Environmental Management at the University of Connecticut with focuses in Sustainable Environmental Planning and Management and Remote Sensing and Geospatial Data Analytics. In my free time, I enjoy attending concerts, cooking, playing video games, and traveling.
