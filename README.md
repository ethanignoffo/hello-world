# About Me:

Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

My name is Ethan Ignoffo and I am currently a senior Environmental Economics & Policy student with a minor in Conservation and Resource Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. I have a deep passion for using data analysis to address environmental challenges and promote sustainable resource management. My expertise lies in applying quantitative analysis, data modeling, and statistical techniques to better understand complex environmental issues, from climate change mitigation to conservation and sustainability.
